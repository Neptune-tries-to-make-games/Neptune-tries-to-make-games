- 👋 Hi, I’m Neptune (can also call me jelly or magnus)
- 👀 I’m interested in making my first game, as ive tried a few years ago despite not having a way to gameify it. i still have the idea and would love to make it come true <3
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code and make a game from scratch :3
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating a game with versitile characters along with slight psychological horror games. the main character of the game im wanting to make is trans and gay, and i have had ideas for it.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at ethermack2025@gmail.com to help me with my project, i could use it (please ive never dont this before)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/they
- ⚡ Fun fact: I myself is trans and gay (mlm), and I like weirdcore, psychological horror, deep meaning, and deep story lines. i write poetry and novels (none of wich are published cuz im shy lmao). i want to make an
inclusive game about a trans character, its pixel psycological horror, its meant to have meaning and depth, i dont have a deep delved idea as i dont remember my past idea very well, but i would love
to do this project, and bring it to life <3
